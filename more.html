            <h1>10 AWESOME FACTS ABOUT NEUTRON STARS</h1>
        </a>
        <p>A neutron star is one of the possible results of a dying star. Depending upon its mass, a star
            transforms into a “white dwarf”, a “neutron star” or a “black hole” after it runs out of its fuel
            (hydrogen). Cores of stars with masses between
            1.4 solar masses and 5-6 solar masses form neutron stars... <a

        <p>WHAT ANCIENT GREEKS THOUGHT? The
            voyage of curiosity to understand this very familiar (yet not completely understood even to this date)
            started back in around 500 B.C. It was the first
            attempt to understand light, scientifically. Many Greek philosophers including Plato and Pythagoras
            believed that light originates in our eyes. It was
            their belief that... <a href="http://cosmopedia8.home.blog/2020/03/25/what-is-light/">Read more</a></p>

            <h1>WHAT IS TIME</h1>
        </a>
        <p>What time is it? It is a simple question to answer, isn’t it? We can tell it’s 12:15. But have you ever
            wondered what
            “time” itself is? Well, let me tell you the story of understanding time, from its absolute universal
            version of Newton
            to the relative time of Einstein. Time is what we measure using clocks. This is a typical answer given
            to this question.
            But it’s not quite satisfying, is it? ... <a

            <h1>COMPARISN OF HUGE NUMBERS</h1>
        </a>
        <p>This interesting fact that the number of moves possible in a chess game is more than the number of atoms
            in the observable
            universe is famous among space enthusiasts and math geeks. It is said that there are about 10120 moves
            possible in a chess
            game and the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated to be around 1080. But, how did
            these unconceivably huge
            numbers come to people. I mean, obviously no one has played 10120 (aka Shannon number) ... <a
